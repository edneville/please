.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[C]please\f[] is a sudo clone that has regex support and a simple
approach to ACL.
.PP
The aim is to allow admins to delegate accurate least privilege access
with ease.
There are times when what is intended to be executed can be expressed
easily with a regex to expose only what is needed and nothing more.
.PP
\f[C]pleaseedit\f[] allows safe editing of files.
The file is copied to /tmp, where it can be updated.
When \f[C]EDITOR\f[] exits cleanly the file is copied alongside the
target and then renamed.
